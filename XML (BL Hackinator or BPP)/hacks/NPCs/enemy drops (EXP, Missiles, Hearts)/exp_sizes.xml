				WARNING!!! Be VERY careful about editing this amount to anything other than 1.
				Doing so may create exp amounts that are impossible to generate. This WILL cause
				unintended behaviors if the game tries to generate such values. For example: If
				the three exp sizes are set to 4, 6, and 8 exp, then an enemy that's set to drop
				5 exp will be buggy. As another example, 10 exp is also impossible with these values
				even though it looks like it can be made with a 4 exp and 6 exp chip, because
				the game will always try to spawn the biggest possible exp chips first, which means
				it will spawn an 8 exp chip leaving the remaining 2 exp unable to be created.
