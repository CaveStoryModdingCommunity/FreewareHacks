		<field type="info">
			Cave Story has a limit of 512 entities. Unfortunately to change this you need a hundred
			tiny patches, so you basically need to start with a different exe (which exists it's called
			"Chocolate CS").

		<field type="info">
			.pxe files (the enemies placed in maps) for some reason start loading at
			position 170, and 90% of spawned NPCs start at index 256. So for the most part 170 entity
			slots are reserved for... a few instances? Yeah maybe change this to 10 (or even zero) so you can
			actually use closer to the actual hard 512 limit instead of the soft 342 limit.
