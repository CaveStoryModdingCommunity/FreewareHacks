# If you are using Booster's Lab:
1. Delete the /hacks/ folder within the Boosters Lab directory folder.
2. Replace it with the folder here. Drag or cut/copy and paste.

##### NOTE: If you do step 2 without doing step 1 and click "replace", this will merge the two folders and could result in a cluttered directory with duplicate patches. That's not recommended (unless you yourself have written or downloaded private patches and already know what you are doing).
