; Points to the start of map flag data (49E5B8) by default.
; If you want to change where the saved weapon data gets stored, edit the addresses below.
; Note that this hack uses 672 bits/flags to store all of the data.
; (e.g., to save the weapon data at the end of the NPC flags array (flags 7328-7999),
; set the first address below to 49E134 and the rest accordingly.)
savedWeapon.level=49E5B8     ; Start of the saved weapon stats data
savedWeapon.exp=49E5B9       ; Must be equal to the previous address + 1
savedWeapon.max_ammo=49E5BA  ; Must be equal to the previous address + 1
savedWeapon.cur_ammo=49E5BC  ; Must be equal to the previous address + 2

; Don't touch any of these addresses (these are vanilla addresses)

gArmsData.exp=499BD0
