a reloading weapon (without autofire...) that's meant to serve as a template
doukutsu assembler format

the default weapon is a nemesis that reloads one bullet per second (as indicated by the reload timer being 0x32)
once again, lots of customisable values... but no autofire unless you comment out the current shooting code and uncomment the code i left over from the previous template up there)
oh right since this is nemesis it has three separate shooting sounds

hopefully i didn't forget anything this time (like i just forgot to fix the bullet family issue)
