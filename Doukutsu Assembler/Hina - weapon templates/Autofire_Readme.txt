a basic autofire weapon that's meant to serve as a template
doukutsu assembler format

there's a section at the top of the code that has nicely customisable values for easy user access - bullet spawn position, sound, bullet IDs, etc.
the weapon USES ammo but doesn't have auto-regen like machine gun does - i could make that separately if needed
