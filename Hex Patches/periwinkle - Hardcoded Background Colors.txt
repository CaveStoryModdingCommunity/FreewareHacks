Changing the hardcoded background colors.
The first address is the color of the screen after a <FAO and the second is the in-game background color (for e.g. background type black)
Each set of 00s represents the rgb of the color in hex.
(note: might actually be bgr instead (flipped) cause endian stuff, need to double check)
