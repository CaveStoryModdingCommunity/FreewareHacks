Autosaving in Cave Story! The game will save every time <TRA is run.
This is done by storing the TRA Event argument to the profile and retrieving/running it for loading.
(It's saved in Map Flag space. Unused in Vanilla and 99% of mods but yeah you can't use map flags (<MP+/<MPJ)
or any hacks using map flag space).
((Also this uses NPC 90 for storing code. An unused NPC in vanilla that does nothing.))

I'm gonna be honest I only tested the first handful of maps. Theoretically this technique of autosave is sound
but I cannot guarantee it will not break somewhere in some conditions. You can TRA into cutscenes fine (try restarting the game during the Mimiga Village cutscene. It works!) it's just I'm not 100% sure EVERY map transition works. It should though theoretically.

There's no way to turn it off either. TRA into the credits? Your player is autosaved there buddy.

BACKUP YOUR MOD for the love of god if you use this it's pretty experimental.

Finally, make sure you read everything here VERY CAREFULLY as there are instructions for handling normal save disks and head.tsc!!!!

Base patches, in order:
1. Inject for TRA saving the Event to profile Map Flag space (the first dword of that space) - FUNC 1
2. Inject for the loading function's TRA to use the saved Event instead of Event 0000 - FUNC 2
3. Inject for the TRA command to save right after - FUNC 3
4. The code where the above three injects point to. This space is NPC 90 which is unused in vanilla.
(So don't spawn NPC 90 it'll break your save)
Func 1: Saves Event to profile
Func 2: Load Game TRA (reads the event from profile)
Func 3: TRA and Save, for the TSC command to go to instead.

===========================================


SUPER IMPORTANT:
You have to do one of two things:
Either:
1. Use <FL+0431 right at the beginning of the game, before the first <TRA of your mod.
OR:
2. Edit events 40, 41, and 42 in head.tsc to replace the <FLJ0431:0048<INI to instead be <EVE0048.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES do you want to <INI from these gameover events, because autosaving doesn't set flag 431.


ALSO IMPORTANT:
Okay so here's the thing, if you aren't gonna use normal <SVP or save disks in your mod,
then just apply this patch:

(Optional) Load game faded out instead of in
0x41D508
E8 83 09 FF FF







If you DO plan on using save disks, there's a hiccup: TRAs like to be faded-out but SVPs like to be faded-in.
(If you have the game load faded-out and use SVP, then you can't see anything when you load that save. BAD!)
So what should loading the game do?

>>>> Option 1 (lazy): Have loading an autosave flash the screen for 1 frame.
Apply this patch:

Patch <SVP so it stores event 0000 (which does nothing).

>>>> Option 2 (Nicer looking): Modify your head.tsc so you always load the game with a fade in.
Step 1: Add this event to the right numerical spot in your head.tsc

#0002
<KEY<FAI0004<END

Step 2: apply these two patches:

(Optional) Load game faded out instead of in
0x41D508

Patch <SVP so it stores event 0002.
