There is a bug in the game causing the last line of text in this example to not show up:
<KEY<MSGText line 1<NOD
Text line 2<NOD
Text line 3<NOD
<CLRThis text will not show up<NOD<END

The same bug also causes wonkiness with this event (note, BL incorrectly strips the blank lines from this event, so use a different editor if you want to see this for yourself):
<KEY<MSG[1] Some text<NOD

[2] Two lines below line [1]<NOD

This text never shows up<NOD
This is drawn above line [2]!<NOD
And this is drawn on top of [2] :)<NOD<END


The following hex patch will fix this bug so that the text will display as you would expect:
